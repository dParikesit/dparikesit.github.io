# About Dimas

Hi, I'm Dimas. I'm an undergraduate researcher at [Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia](https://itb.ac.id/en/)

I like doing systems programming, ML/AI projects, creating websites (only the backend part), and busying myself with my homelab. I also like to discuss things with my peers and underclassmen.

You can take a look at my projects on [Github](https://github.com/dParikesit)

# Connect with me!

Feel free to send an email to [dsparikesit@gmail.com](mailto:dsparikesit@gmail.com)
You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimas-parikesit/), but I rarely open it.

If you want to learn more about doing research, I'm more than happy to share how I got into it and how you can do it too! Just email me and we can talk about it.
